       Hello, and welcome to my EBook. Here I have collated all of my reserach and work into one place for you to browse. There are 4 sections to this EBook; Information Age, Digital Divide, Online Services and Sources. In Sources you will find any information or image that I have used throughout the EBook and any other related information will be there.
     </p>
     <p>
       To make this EBook I used a variety of programs. This includes programs such as; Dreamweaver, Sublime Text, Photoshop, Fireworks and and Internet Browser. The website was made almost entirely in the code section of Dreamweaver and Sublime Text to ensure that all the back end work was looking nice, using a pinch of Java Script to enable ease of use of my website. I made my self a basic template using css called "app.css" which allows me to edit the webpage "template" so if I make a small adjustment I dont have to go and change all the other webpages as well.
     </p>
     <p>
       My website also uses the Bootstrap framework to make sure that the website will work on different monitor sizes and even phones, but also so that it allows me to create a clean looking website using 3rd party tools instead of dreamweavers inbuilt ones. Bootstrap also means that there are less rendered images, it is using boxes and margins between components to position them selves accordingly from one another, stopping it looking cluttered. This also means that my website is lighter weight and uses up less of the PC's resources to make it run, especially on devices such as mobile phones or tablets.
     </p>
     <p>
       Overall making this EBook has taught me allot, feel free to browse.

     <h1>Evaluation</h1>
     <hr>
     <h3>EBook evaluation</h3>
     <p>
       In my EBook I covered 3 main areas. These main areas were introduction, Digital divide and Life in the information age. Overall I covered these on separate pages which are linked to each other via a button which you can press at the top of each page which is easy to access. I covered the main areas for each point and then further information was also supplied if needed. 
     </p>
     <p>
       The structure of my EBook was quite straight forward, it has 5 pages that are of a similar layout however the top banner differs in some way. They are all similar in length and can also provide hyperlinks to other information that is not present on the main page for easier reading purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
       I have laid it out in a way that the page will fit most computer monitors, but to fit lots of different information the pages are long but easy to scroll down and see the information. The main attractions of the page are laid out at the top while the less important information is laid out at the bottom. There are other small information snippets that are throughout as well such as the fun fact tile that is played in the background.
     </p>
     <p>
       I have used a variety of multimedia components in my EBook as well to give my EBook a more professional feel. For every page I have made a banner using multimedia software to create an animated image that is easily seen when you open a page or visit a different one. I have also created a Fun facts multimedia object where it shows you a variety of facts to enlighten the reading further down the page. My buttons also have a small animation for when they are being hovered over so that you know that you have selected the right  button.
     </p>
     <p>
       I have presented the EBook in a formal manner. I use easy to read and bold fonts most of the time so that people of different ages are able to read it. I have also got a simple layout that is straight forward and easy to follow so you don’t get lost through all the writing. I have also made sure to use easy to distinguish colours that aren’t too bright so that the contrast of the screen they use wont impact of the website viewing experience. 
     </p>
     <p>
       I have made a separate page for each main area and the other main areas too. This means that there is less clicking to do when navigating my EBook. All of the links for the pages are at the top meaning that you can click through them since they will also be at the top of the next page. This means that you can easily browse my EBook without scrolling lots which makes my page easier to navigate. The page also fits a standard 16:9 screen very well as the size is designed for it, however some older monitors may not have the full privilege of the wider display and will have to scroll to the left or the right sometimes.
     </p>
     <p>
       Overall my EBook is quite consistent as the page layout between the pages is very similar  ad the experience across all the pages is the same. The colours that I used are also present across all pages and the fonts and layout style also stay the same. This makes for a better viewing experience of my EBook as the professional feel comes through when all the pages are of a similar context.
     </p>

     <p>
       Overall my EBook is accessible however it may not fit all types of people. I aimed for less clicking to get to information and use the idea of longer pages. This idea was backed up with my research of different websites such as the BBC where they use longer pages to include more information than clicking lots of different links. So I followed this approach and I feel that It has given me a good result. Some people with different size monitors to the standard may have a slight more difficulty with scrolling left or right but overall the colours and layout that I used are easy to see, and the fonts are bold with no funny characters. Overall quite an accessible EBook.
     </p>
     <p>
       My EBook is also fit for purpose as it aims primarily at the target audience of which was specified. The website was designed to fit the audience of anyone with internet access, but it also had to fit the genre of people viewing this in 100 years. To achieve this I had to make sure that in my text or worded speech throughout the EBook there were no hyperlinks in case text hyperlinks had changed in 100 years time. I also made sure that the design was quite simplistic so that in 100 years times they won’t find it old fashioned or too random. The way that the pages are linked and can be accessed through the internet also means anyone with a computer and internet access can view my pages and their content.
     </p>
     <h3>My Performance</h3>
     <p>
       Overall I believe I have performed well, however there are areas that I could have improved on as well as areas that I have done well in.
     </p>
     <p>
       I believe that the way and techniques that I used to create the pages was thought out well and gave me a good result, however I also think that I could have spent more time designing the smaller aspects of my website to add more detail to stop my website looking blank In some places. However I feel that the assets used were used appropriately and gave a good effect and feel for a professional EBook, although I could have spent more time sources and creating the assets to achieve a more professional look but time was a constraint that meant that I had to deal with what I had got.
     </p>
     <p>
       I also feel that I have laid the pages out in a way that I would be comfortable in viewing them, although I could have spent more time in planning a way in which they can be viewed on different size and aspects of monitors, however again time was a constraint and that kind of functionality is out of my current skill level.
     </p>
     <h3>Feedback</h3>
     <p>
       Friend 1- Ryan

       “Harry’s EBook looks really nice actually, its something that I could feel my self using or find on the internet as an established website.”
     </p>
     <p>
       Friend 2- Tony
     </p>
     <p>
       “I’m not to keen on Harry’s colour choice for his EBook as there is allot of grey and I would like some more brighter colours in there."
     </p>
     <p>
       Friend 3- Cameron   
     </p>
     <p>
      “I like the style that he has gone for, however it is quite simple which for some might be less appealing about the EBook. The EBook code also seems to have some bugs in regards to navigation on the left menu.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Overall I am pleased with the feedback in which I got, there are some good and some bad points in which I can build some points for improvement on.
   </p>
   <h3>Improvement</h3>
   <p>
     I believe my main points for improvement are, colour scheme and the website size to fit different monitors. If I learn to use java script to make more fluid animations, and bootstrap better to be able to resize the website for me. I will also use a survey next time to find a colour scheme that will suit my website and/or target audience better. Futhermore next time I will allocate more time to go over my .html and CSS code to try and get rid of some of the bugs that may be hurting the EBook experience such as wrong navigation indicators.
     All in all, my next shot at an EBook or website should allow me to create a more polished experience that what I have made already. Furthermore I would have been able to properly learnt how to use the CSS full background image code, however I couldn't get it to work in time, so time allocation again will help me greatly.
